# Learn AVS (WIP)
A collection of resources to learn about AVSs in EigenLayer.

For resources on EigenLayer check out [EigenLayer Hub](https://web3citizen.notion.site/EigenLayer-Hub-0d87bfebd4fe47739a4d0ef8a2e7d45f).

## Data Availability
EigenDA
---

EigenDA stands as a secure, high-throughput, and decentralized data availability service built on top of Ethereum, utilizing the EigenLayer restaking primitive.
EigenDA is the first actively validated service (AVS) on EigenLayer providing low-cost, data availability to rollups.

## ZK Coprocessors
Brevis
---
Brevis is a smart zero-knowledge coprocessor that empowers smart contracts to read from, verify and utilize the full historical on-chain data from any chain and run customizable computations in a completely trust-free way. Use cases include zkBridges, ZK identity, social account abstraction, data-driven dApps among others.

Brevis coChain accepts coprocessing requests from smart contracts and optimistically generates the results secured by a restaking quorum. Brevis was one of the first AVSs to go live on mainnet.

## Consensus Layer for DePIN economies
Witness Chain
---
Witness Chain is building the coordination layer to unify Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) economies.

By becoming an AVS, EigenLayer infrastructure can now be utilized to achieve consensus on physical state. Unverified physical attributes of DePIN networks can now become measured, verifiable digital proofs. These proofs can later be attested or challenged, and consumed by apps or chains to build products and services.
