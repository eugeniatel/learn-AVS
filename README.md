# EigenLayer's AVS
EigenDA
---
EigenDA stands as a secure, high-throughput, and decentralized data availability service built on top of Ethereum, utilizing the EigenLayer restaking primitive.
EigenDA is the first actively validated service (AVS) on EigenLayer providing low-cost, data availability to rollups.

Witness Chain
---
Witness Chain is building the coordination layer to unify De-centralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) economies. 

By becoming an AVS, EigenLayer infrastructure can now be utilized to achieve consensus on physical state. Unverified physical attributes of DePIN networks can now become measured, verifiable digital proofs. These proofs can later be attested or challenged, and consumed by apps or chains to build products and services.
